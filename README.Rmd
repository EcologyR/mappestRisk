The goal of mappestRisk package is to facilitate the transition from development data of pests obtained in lab-controlled conditions to understandable forecasts assessing risk of pest occurrence in a certain region.

For that purpose, mappestRisk is built upon previous efforts such as `devRate` [@rebaudo2018], `rTPC` and `nls.multstart` packages [@padfield2021] and a methodology for predicting climatic suitability based on fundamental thermal niche as estimated by mechanistic, process-based approaches suggested in @taylor2019 . Therefore, mappestRisk has three different modules: *(1) model fitting & selection* using a set of the most used equations describing developmental responses to temperature under `nls.multstart` [@nls.multstart] and `nlme` [@nlme] frameworks with visualization of model fitting to help model selection by the user; (2) *thermal traits extraction:* including selection of the suitability threshold guiding the forecast (i.e. obtaining the temperatures at which estimated performance lies upon a performance higher threshold percentage); and (3) *climatic data extraction & visualization* with either exportable rasters or interactive maps with `leaflet` [@leaflet].

## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EcologyR/mappestRisk")

#or alternatively
remotes::install_github("EcologyR/mappestRisk")

#and load the package
library(mappestRisk)
```

## Example: mappestRisk workflow

### 1. Fit a thermal performance curve to your data:

In this example, we'll show how to fit one to several thermal performance curves to a data set of development rate variation across temperatures[^1]. The following code provides an example as given in `fit_devmodels()` function documentation, with a data table showing the output of fitted models.

[^1]: At least 4 unique temperatures are required. Fore more details, see *vignette*.

```{r, message=FALSE}

data("h.vitripennis_pilkington2014")

fitted_tpcs_sharpshooter <- fit_devmodels(temp = h.vitripennis_pilkington2014$temperature,
              dev_rate = h.vitripennis_pilkington2014$rate_development,
              model_name = c("all"), #might be a bit slow
              variance_model = "exp") 
DT::datatable(fitted_tpcs_sharpshooter)
```

### 2. Plot fitted TPCs and select the most appropriate:

To help select which model might be more appropriate, the function `plot_devmodels()` draws the predicted TPCs for each adequately-converged model. This step aims to improve model selection based not only on statistical criteria (i.e. AIC and number of parameters) but also on ecological realism, since curves can be graphically checked to select realistic shapes and thermal traits --vertical cuts with x-axis such as $CT_\min$, $CT_\max$ and $T_{opt}$ .

```{r, warning=FALSE}
#library(ggplot2)
plot_devmodels(temp = h.vitripennis_pilkington2014$temperature,
               dev_rate = h.vitripennis_pilkington2014$rate_development,
               fitted_parameters = fitted_tpcs_sharpshooter)
```

### 3. Calculate thermal suitability bounds:

Once a model have been selected under both ecological realism and statistical criteria, the user can estimate the thermal boundaries defining the suitable range of temperatures for the studied population. The `thermal_suitability_bounds()` function calculate these values given the `fitted_parameters` output from `fit_devmodels()` and the selected model name. Additionally, a value of suitability defining the quantile-upper part of the curve can be providen by the user. The output is a data.frame with the model name, the suitability threshold and the two *thermal boundaries* required for the mapping functions (as described below).

```{r, warning=FALSE}
thermal_boundaries_sharpshooter <- thermal_suitability_bounds(fitted_parameters = fitted_tpcs_sharpshooter,
                           model_name = "briere1", # <- seems realistic according to `plot_devmodels()` and `fit_devmodels()` outputs
                           suitability_threshold = 75)
print(thermal_boundaries_sharpshooter)
```

### 4. Climatic data extraction and projection

```{r}
# downloading data from geodata::wordlclim_global. It will takes several minutes the first time you download the data.
risk_rast <- map_risk(t_vals = c(thermal_boundaries_sharpshooter$tval_left,
                                 thermal_boundaries_sharpshooter$tval_right),
                      path = "~/downloaded_maps", # directory to download data
                      region = "Réunion", 
                      verbose = TRUE)
terra::plot(risk_rast[[13]]) # the last layer represents the sum of suitable months within a year; the 12-th previous ones, the monthly binary value (1, if suitable; 0, if not suitable).

# Alternatively, if you already have a raster of monthly average temperatures for your region of interest, you can use it as an input of `map_risk()`
## load it (here Luxembourg data)
tavg_file <- system.file("extdata/tavg_lux.tif", package = "mappestRisk")
## convert it into a raster-compatible file with `terra`
tavg_rast <- terra::rast(tavg_file)
## and apply the function
risk_rast_binary <- map_risk(t_vals = c(thermal_boundaries_sharpshooter$tval_left,
                                        thermal_boundaries_sharpshooter$tval_right), 
                             t_rast = tavg_rast)
terra::plot(risk_rast[[13]]) # the last layer represents the sum of suitable months within a year; the 12-th previous ones, the monthly binary value (1, if suitable; 0, if not suitable).
